# Mandelbrot viewer

An interactive and GPU-accelerated viewer for the Mandelbrot set.

Implemented as an extension of the CUDA sample "simpleCUDA2GL", which uses OpenGL and freeGLUT to bind a frame buffer object to an openGL 2D texture.

Use the included CMakeLists.txt to compile. Note that it requires the cuda-samples "Common" header files.
